Things learned:

- Rotating along an axis which is on one of the three standard planes only requires three rotations. E.g. rotating along axis on XY plane of angle A with x axis can be done as follows:

RotateZ (90 - A) to orient axis up
RotateY (amount) to do the rotation
RotateZ (- (90 - A)) to orient axis back
